Flood Risk Predictive Modeling Project (focusing on Louisiana during Hurricane Katrina)
Here’s a link to our [grand finale presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cnOvEcYDPpWeU7KXSC3-1x_Zo9vJlrAeIj1GePvU5xc/edit#slide=id.gbbe8377fb8_2_26), which is shorter and has a different central message than our [first, more technical presentation to our TA group](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SUas4PUet6Dz9Z2t-EhbQJsXCrb3hw-7qfHf-M5Hdgk/edit#slide=id.g4dfce81f19_0_45). Further, [here’s a link to our dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/d1b74776-4a0e-48b8-a5c8-fc41016b32a2/page/uR20B)! Finally, here's a poster overview of our project:

As for the purposes of each notebook in this repository, "Naive Bayes, Random Forest, ANN, XGBoost Analysis" is our main analysis and modeling, so we kindly recommend that you check that out first. For our cleaning processes, "NFIP Cleaning, Naive Linear Regression, Feature Selection" is the place to go. If you're curious about exactly how we dealt with the NFHL flood hazard layer data, please heck out "Flood Hazard Data", and for other fundamental EDA, please check out "Team 17 EDA." Thanks!
